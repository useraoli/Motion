# 📕 About Motion
Motion is a lightweight tweening library designed as an improved alternative to [TweenService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TweenService). The library uses bezier curves as easing functions, allowing you to define and import custom easing curves. By using the website [Cubic Bezier](https://cubic-bezier.com/#0,0,1,1), you can design and import curves for your tweens. The library focuses on providing cleaner, modular, and customizable workflows when it comes to tweening.

# 📝 Features
1. **Custom easing curves** - The user is no longer limited to pre-made easing curves and can now create their own to use for tweening.
2. **Custom playback framerate** - When running the tween, the user can specify the framerate of the animation.
3. **Custom playback speed** - A custom playback speed can be used to determine the speed of the animation.
4. **Overridable update scheduler** - The user decides whether it updates automatically or use their own update handler.
